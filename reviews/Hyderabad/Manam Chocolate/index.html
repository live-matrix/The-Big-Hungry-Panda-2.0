                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Manam Chocolate Karkhana was clearly not just another chocolate shop that I had stepped into! it was a full fledged bean to bar chocolate factory, which means that they control the entire chocolate making process, that starts with they sourcing High Quality Indian Cacao Beans. Unlike commercial chocolate brands in India that rely on mass produced cocoa from West Africa or South America, Manam works with Indian farmers, primarily from regions like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, to cultivate very distinct cacao profiles.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The process begins with careful selection of cacao beans, ensuring they are naturally fermented and dried to enhance their flavour. The team experiments with different fermentation techniques to bring out specific tasting notes like fruity, nutty, or earthy creating chocolates that are not just sweet treats but deeply flavourful, terroir driven confections. The roasting, grinding, conching, and tempering happen on site at the Karkhana and visitors can see every step of the process from behind large glass panels.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                What sets Manam Chocolate apart is that it’s not just about chocolate, it’s also a full fledged cafe that serves high quality food, which is an unexpected yet delightful surprise. Many chocolate boutiques focus solely on sweets, but here, they’ve gone the extra mile to craft a menu that pairs beautifully with their chocolates. The space blends industrial aesthetics with warm, inviting elements, reflecting the dual identity of a working chocolate factory and a cafe.

                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Smoked Salmon Toast - Rs 700 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This was, without a doubt, the highlight of the entire trip. A thick slice of well toasted sourdough formed the perfect base, offering a satisfying crunch that paired beautifully with the silky, melt in your mouth smoked salmon. A light spread of creamy, tangy cheese tied everything together, while a hint of dill and capers added just the right amount of freshness. Every bite was well balanced, rich without being overwhelming, making it the kind of dish you’d order again without hesitation and you know what! we did exactly that, we ordered another plate of this beauty.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Avakai Falafel - Rs 440 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A fantastic fusion of Middle Eastern and Andhra flavors, this dish took the familiar falafel and gave it a bold, unexpected twist. The falafel itself was crisp and well seasoned, but the real magic was in the hummus. Instead of traditional olive oil, they drizzled it with Avakai Oil (Basically A raw Mango Pickle Oil), it's fiery, pickled tang cutting through the creaminess in the best way possible. The nuttiness of the chickpeas, combined with the punch of spice from the avakai, made this a standout dish that left a lasting impression for Yugadi and I.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Chicken Liver Gravy - Rs 470 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Now this one turned out to be a comforting, rich dish that delivered an intense burst of flavour in every bite. The chicken liver was cooked to perfection! smooth and creamy without any overpowering bitterness, blended into a luscious, well spiced gravy that also had mini chunks of liver in there as well. The thick cut brioche underneath absorbed all those bold, meaty juices, turning soft and buttery with every bite. It was hearty, indulgent, and full of depth, the kind of dish that surprises you with how good it is.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Breakfast Kheema Paratha - Rs 325  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This was that one dish that didn’t hit the mark. While the paratha was flaky and the kheema filling had decent flavour, there was nothing particularly special about it. The seasoning felt a little underwhelming, and for the price, it didn’t feel worth it, especially considering you can find much better versions at local eateries for a fraction of the cost. Compared to the other dishes, this one lacked that extra effort or uniqueness that made the rest of the meal shine. If you notice closely, you can see something yellow in the middle well that unfortunately was our sunny side up, which wasn't all that sunny and well it was way overcooked instead.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Pain Au Chocolat - Rs 230  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A textbook take on this classic pastry beautifully laminated layers that shattered with every bite, on the inside a smooth, slightly bitter chocolate filling. The balance was just right not overly sweet, with a good contrast between the crisp, buttery pastry and the rich chocolate inside. It wasn’t the best I’ve had, but it was solid enough to be a satisfying treat post the lovely meal we've had.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Almond and Cacao Croissant - Rs 250  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This was an elevated take on the usual almond croissant, with the addition of cacao giving it an extra layer of complexity. The croissant was perfectly flaky on the outside, while the inside was soft, slightly chewy, and packed with a rich almond filling. The cacao added just a touch of bitterness to balance the sweetness, making it more nuanced and less sugary than a typical almond croissant. It was well executed, offering a nice balance of textures and flavours in each bite and would make for a delicious treat at High Tea oh and not to forget a pairing of Scones as well alongside this.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Triple Chocolate Croissant - Rs 250  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A dream for chocolate lovers, this croissant was pure indulgence. Each bite was filled with layers of gooey chocolate dark, milk, and white, melting together into a rich, decadent filling. The pastry itself was airy and crisp, with a perfect golden crust, but the chocolate was the real star here. It had just the right level of sweetness, allowing the depth of the cocoa to shine through without being cloying. If you’re looking for a breakfast pastry that doubles as dessert, THIS IS IT !
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Fig & Mascarpone Tart - Rs 270  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This one didn’t quite hit the mark for me. While the tart shell was well made, crisp and buttery but the overall flavour leaned too much on the tangy side. The mascarpone filling, instead of being rich and creamy, had a sharper edge that overpowered the natural sweetness of the figs. The fruit itself was fresh, but it didn’t do enough to balance out the tartness, making the whole thing feel slightly off. It wasn’t necessarily bad, but it lacked the harmony I was expecting in a dessert like this.
                            </p>
