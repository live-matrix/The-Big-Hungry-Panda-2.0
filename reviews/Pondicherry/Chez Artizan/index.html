                                We dropped by Chez Artizan in the late afternoon for lunch, a place I’d been meaning to visit for quite some time. I had a few dishes on my must-try list, but sadly, a couple of them had been taken off the menu some months back. The only ones that made it through were the Pork Belly and Ramen, which I was still pretty excited to try.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Established in October 2022 by Chef Kathiron and Ms. Bijayalaxmi Mishra, Chez Artizan is a cozy gem tucked away on Mission Street in Pondicherry. The restaurant champions sustainable ingredients and offers a modern, thoughtful spin on comfort food. It’s one of those slightly underrated spots that still feels like a secret perfect for anyone who enjoys finding places that fly under the radar.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The open kitchen adds a personal touch, letting diners watch the chefs at work, there’s something genuinely enjoyable about seeing a meal come together right in front of you. With just 4–5 tables, the space feels intimate and calm, ideal for a quiet, unhurried meal. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, though the pricing leans a little on the higher side.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The food here can be a bit of a hit or miss, but when it hits, it really does. The menu blends Euro-Asian influences with finesse, think wild mushroom soup, pork belly, ramen, and a decadent Chocolate Pot de Crème (which was sadly sold out that day). Pair that with their refreshing fruit presses or a crisp salad, and you’ve got a well-rounded, satisfying dining experience.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Batered Fish Fritters - Rs 400  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This was an absolute treat! Perfectly golden and crisp on the outside, the fish inside was tender and flaky, just how I like it. What really pulled it all together was the side salad for a fresh crunch and that sweet chili sauce-sticky, tangy, and with just the right amount of heat. Trust me, every bite was a flavour bomb!
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Fried Burrata With Garlic Baguette - Rs 450 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The burrata was creamy as expected, but the crispy coating lacked that wow factor. While the garlic baguette was well-toasted and flavourful, it didn’t elevate the dish beyond being just alright. It’s not something I’d go back for.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Miso Shoyu Chicken Ramen - Rs 450 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Not the most authentic bowl of Ramen but it was definitely a bowl of comfort done right! The broth was beautifully flavorful yet light on spices, making it easy to savor every spoonful. The slightly crisp fried chicken pieces added a delightful texture and were packed with flavor. Overall, it’s a dish I’d definitely recommend for anyone craving a satisfying, well-balanced ramen experience.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Belgium Pork Belly - Rs 650  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The Belgium Pork Belly was a letdown, especially since I had such high expectations for it. Sadly, the meat was overcooked and ended up being unpleasantly chewy, which completely overshadowed the dish. For the price, it was disappointing, though the sauce and salad on the side did manage to shine with their flavors. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the experience I had hoped for.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Che'z Artizan's Ice Tea - Rs 170  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Their in-house iced tea was an absolute winner! Refreshingly cold with just the right balance of sweetness and a subtle hint of citrus, it was the perfect thirst-quencher. Light, flavorful, and perfectly brewed, it’s one of those drinks you’d happily keep sipping on all day.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Tiramisu Rs 350  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The classic tiramisu was a nice way to end the meal! It was a bit on the sweeter side, but the rich layers of creamy mascarpone and coffee-soaked ladyfingers still made it enjoyable. Despite the sweetness, it had that comforting, familiar taste that’s hard to resist, definitely a treat for tiramisu lovers.
                            </p>

                                    Chez Artizan feels like one of those places built from genuine passion rather than pretense. You can sense the care that goes into every detail from the sourcing of ingredients to the plating itself. Sure, not every dish landed perfectly, but the ones that did were memorable enough to make the visit worthwhile. It’s the kind of restaurant that rewards curiosity, especially if you enjoy places that experiment without losing their soul. For anyone looking to experience Pondicherry’s evolving culinary scene beyond the obvious cafés, Chez Artizan deserves a spot on the list, just maybe don’t pin all your hopes on the pork belly.
