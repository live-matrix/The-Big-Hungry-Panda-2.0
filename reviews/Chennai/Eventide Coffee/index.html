                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 There’s something instantly grounding about walking into Eventide Coffee, a new café that captures the very essence of minimalism, not just in its design but in the atmosphere it creates. The space is raw yet refined, with unfinished textures, clean corners, and materials that invite touch rather than hide behind polish. Every element from the seating layout to the lighting and even the placement of plants feels thoughtfully curated and functional, as if each corner was designed with purpose and intent.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Natural light floods the café through a large skylight situated above the coffee bar, softening the rugged concrete tones and adding warmth to the overall space. There are no distractions here, no flashy décor or over the top music, just a calm rhythm that makes you want to slow down and stay a little longer. They also plan to introduce a few outdoor tables soon, both at the front and back, to make the space even more inviting for those who love the open-air café vibe.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                Eventide is a refreshing new addition to ECR’s growing café culture, a space that feels like it’s built for quiet moments, good coffee, and easy conversation.

                        <!-- Here's What I Had -->
                        <div class="mb-8">
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> <center> Here's What I Had </center> </h2>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Honey Toast – Rs 375 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 I began with the Honey Toast and Misu Espresso, and to my surprise, the toast arrived in under five minutes, impressively quick. The Honey Toast itself looked beautiful: a thick, golden slice of brioche topped with silky mascarpone cream and shards of chewy honeycomb candy. Each bite offered a delightful contrast of creamy, chewy, and crisp textures. The only downside was that it wasn’t served warm. It’s meant to be served that way, and the warmth would have elevated the dish immensely. Still, it was rich, indulgent, and easily one of the most memorable things I tried that day.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Misu Espresso – Rs 300 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The Misu Espresso is their inventive twist on the classic tiramisu. Instead of layering the dessert, they serve espresso poured over savoiardi biscuits, condensed milk, topped with airy mascarpone cream. It’s rich, dessert-like, and satisfying, though personally I found it a touch too sweet perhaps skipping the condensed milk might make it even better for those who prefer a more balanced cup.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Blue Cheese Swirls – Rs 225</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Next came the Blue Cheese Swirls, and these are truly something special. Imagine buttery, flaky pastry with a sharp hint of blue cheese, the richness softened by a drizzle of honey and the crunch of chopped walnuts. The interplay of salty, sweet, and nutty flavours is exquisite. The only downside? They vanish too quickly, two bites and it’s gone. This is one dish that definitely deserves a larger serving.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Ham & Camembert Puff – Rs 350  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The Ham & Camembert Puff carried that same buttery lightness, with the melted Camembert lending a luxurious creaminess to the smoky ham. It’s comforting and flavourful, something you’d want alongside your first coffee of the day.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Tomato Confit Galette – Rs 250</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Moving on to the Tomato Confit Galette, this one had a rustic, homey charm. The pastry was beautifully crisp, and the slow-roasted tomatoes added a burst of sweetness. However, the pesto that accompanied it fell a little flat, it could use a touch more salt or acidity to lift the dish. Even so, the galette itself stood strong on texture and technique.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Focaccia – Rs 275 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The Focaccia, on the other hand, didn’t quite meet expectations. The flavour profile felt a bit off, lacking the signature olive oil richness that defines a good focaccia. It was served with balsamic vinegar on the side, but even that couldn’t quite bring it to life. A tweak in the recipe and a stronger presentation could easily elevate this dish.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Iced Clementine Pour Over – Rs 320 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                For coffee, I chose the Iced Clementine Pour Over, a light-medium roast that promised bright citrus notes. It was refreshing but didn’t quite land perfectly on the palate, perhaps a slightly different ratio could make it shine. Still, it showed care in preparation and was pleasant enough for a warm afternoon.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Berry Lemonade – Rs 250 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The Berry Lemonade rounded off the meal beautifully! vibrant, tangy, and refreshing. It’s the kind of drink that hits the reset button after rich flavours, and it made me curious to explore more of Eventide’s non-coffee beverages in future visits.
                            </p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    Eventide Coffee is more than just another café on ECR! it’s a thoughtfully built space that celebrates simplicity, texture, and calm. The design feels intentional, the menu ambitious, and the service warm without being intrusive. While a few dishes could use minor tweaks, the overall experience is deeply satisfying and refreshingly honest.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    They do add a 12% service charge to the bill, but it’s optional if you feel the service didn’t quite hit the mark.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    For me, Eventide fills a gap that Chennai’s café scene didn’t even realize it had, a place that lets you slow down, savour your coffee, and actually breathe. It’s close to home, and I have a feeling it’s going to be one of those spots I keep coming back to, especially as they continue to evolve their menu and space.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                    Sometimes, less really is more and Eventide Coffee proves it beautifully.
