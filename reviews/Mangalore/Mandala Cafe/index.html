                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 There are cafés you remember for their coffee, and then there are cafés you remember for how they made you feel. Mandala Café was one of those rare places that offered both a space where time slowed down just enough for you to soak in its warmth. Perched like a tranquil treehouse in the heart of Mangalore, it was as much a haven for thinkers and artists as it was for coffee lovers. Every corner reflected the café’s eco-conscious spirit, repurposed wood, potted greens, woven textures, and the scent of freshly brewed beans mingling with coastal air.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 Long before sustainability became a buzzword, Mandala Café was quietly redefining what it meant to be mindful not just of what we eat, but of how we live. It wasn’t just about sipping an espresso or diving into a slice of cake; it was about participating in a philosophy. The conversations here flowed as easily as the coffee, the ambience felt intimate yet freeing, and every dish or drink seemed to carry a story worth savoring.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">   Cappucino - Rs 110 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 A cupp’a cappuccino is probably the first term coffee explorers encounter, also the popular visual of steamy milk foam being swirled into a shot of espresso in a myriad of patterns. Relished by all, including those who don’t like the frankness of pure americano, or generally dislike coffee. The best way to savour the delicate notes of the coffee bean is to refrain from the customary spoonful of sugar (as enjoyed by moi). If you’re a coffee noobie, that sugar sachet would probably be welcome to douse the bitterness to a manageable level.

                            </p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Affogato is the ‘people pleasing’ child of the espresso, who mingled with ice cream to create a dessert most people would cosy up to. When scoops of ice cream (often vanilla) are topped with the concentrated espresso, milky sweetness & fragrant coffee hit close to taste bud nirvana. This was likely the way to have ‘coffee ice cream’ before dairy companies began mass manufacturing that flavour. Espresso is similarly a base in many other coffee drinks.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  V60 - Price Varies Bean To Bean </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                V60, a funnel model used to brew coffee via a pourover method, yields a brooding, intense cuppa. As of yet, they have 3 different roast variants; light using jumping ant from Black Baza Coffee , medium light & medium, which both have wanderloo from Black Baza Coffee & parama from Maveric and Farmer . If you’re looking for a layered intensity, v60 is for you.

                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Siphon - Price Varies Bean To Bean </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                An old-school syphon used to brew coffee has 2 chambers, & employs the scientific principle of vacuum to siphon warmed water from the lower chamber to soak the beans housed up. A constant positive pressure difference due to presence of heated water vapour maintains the set-up, & the beans form a coffee slurry gradually, which can then be decanted once done. Mandala is the only café in mangalore to use a siphon & it’s a veritable pleasure to watch Abdul operating this steampunk-seque machine.

                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Aeropress - Price Varies Bean To Bean </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Aeropress is another device, this time created by a stanford brainiac in the early 2000’s, that forces coffee bean slurry through a filter using a plunger. It’s gotten so popular that it’s got its own world championship, & now it’s at mandala.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Cold Mocha - Rs 160 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Mocaccino or mocha is a kid-favourite form of latté (a cappuccino without the milk foam) that’s got cocoa powder & sugar added, to serve a dual purpose of hot chocolate along with the shot of caffeine. An end product that brings to mind irish coffee; which uses whiskey with the coffee & sugar.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Chicken Quiche - Rs 40 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The quiche, a french savoury tart, when baked well, is creamy & meaty, this one admittedly was a tad salty during the initial bakes. That’s all been improved now, so you need to try this spiced chicken tart, and in case we forget to mention, the gheeroast tart as well. Grab that zingy one as soon as you see it!
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Cold Chicken Sandwich - Rs 80 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Cold chicken sandwiches when chock full of peppered cream, a choice veggie (tends to be thin slices of capsicum or carrot) & juicy shredded chicken, are a no-brainer as a delicious snack. I’ve been relishing them right from my school days in bahrain, & here my college canteen used to stock some piquant sandwiches as well. Takes one back.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Basil Pesto Cheese Swirl - Rs 60 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Basil pesto cheese swirls are puff pastries with a dried slathering of fragrant pesto sauce, some sharp cheese in the nooks and crannies & a crackling texture of puff filo. These are best when hot, but a decent handful on the go as well, especially for vegetarians.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Cinnamon Roll - Rs 70 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Cinnamon rolls? Well, what’s to write about these spiced parcels of bliss? The buttery, cinnamon dusted glaze atop the swirls provides much of the decadent fragrance, while the soft mouthfeel comes from the warm puffy slightly-sweet dough. The danes have a good thing coming for giving the world this magnum opus.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Chocolate Chip Cookies - Rs 30 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The choco chip cookies are hands down a chocolatey affair of crunch, & a prime accompaniment to any quiet shenanigans planned on the cyber front or otherwise. Grab them and dunk them in the coffee of your choice. Trust me.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Whole wheat brownies are like having the cake & eating it too. Or the brownie. Same thing? Well, there’s a satisfaction in knowing that the gummy maida doesn’t enter your system, and its healthier that way. What’s more, it’s just as scrumptious as a normal chocolatey brownie.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Muffins are a big-headed cousin of the cupcake, and if they’re delish, they have every right to be. The oat banana muffin has the tropical sweetness of banana, matured from the bake, and the astringency of the oat. Moderately sweet, & nothing more. Blueberry muffins are good but this ain’t a slacker.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                ‘purin’ or japanese pudding is more like a cream caramel, but smoother & finer in the balance of flavours, noticeable from a minimal eggy flavour, distinct in custard flans otherwise. The coffee flavour here was akin to a hint as compared to the stronger vanilla, but the overall texture and flavours did render it worth the gobble.

                                Doughnuts have just a few requirements; the dough should be fluffy & fragrant, the glaze should be light & work well with the dough, & they should be fresh. If all these are met, even something as minimally decked as the ‘original glazed’ can become anyone’s staple junk food!

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Apple Almond Cake - Rs 70 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The apple almond cake is the type of compact cake one would like to stock up on long expeditions. It keeps, doesn’t spoil the fastest, and the flavour remains for long. It doesn’t hurt that apple & almond stoically appeal to many.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Multi Seed Bar - Rs 50 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Multi seed bars are the handiest accompaniment on long journeys, & are as good as edible bars of dynamite. Why? They’re dry & keep well, they’ve got an arsenal of roast nuts & seeds jammed together with what’s often date or organic edible gum, & if you’re familiar with the bars often kept at the check out counters at supermarkets, a flavour bomb. Pumpkin seeds, white sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, pistachio, figs, you name it!

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Kombucha - Rs 110 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Scoby doby doo! The trending drink in town of late, kombucha (or booch as is fashionable) is a fermented probiotic chinese tea. When sugared tea is introduced to a gelato-fibrinous mat of symbiotic culture of bacteria & yeast (scoby), the sugar gets used as fuel & the liquid becomes acidic, & bubbly. An ethanol production is also seen, but its mostly negligible, in the range of 0.5-1%. The pleasure in a good kombucha comes from the fermented flavour & the purported health benefits. These guys stock up on Burpme Kombucha , that’s homemade & unpasteurized. They also have tepache, a mexican drink fermented from the peel & rind of pineapples (which are usually inedible), which they source from The Gut Culture these are ideal for those who refrain from caffeine!

                                    Mandala Café may have closed its doors, but its essence lingers on in every memory it brewed, and in every person who ever found solace under its leafy canopy. It wasn’t merely a café! it was a gentle reminder that food and coffee, when crafted with purpose and consciousness, can become an experience that nourishes far beyond the palate. For those of us lucky enough to have visited, Mandala remains not just a chapter in Mangalore’s culinary past, but a benchmark for what soulful dining truly feels like.
