                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 What started as one of Mangalore’s most beloved breakfast and brunch spots has only evolved over the years into a full-blown continental haven. Diesel Café has long been a household name for those who crave hearty comfort food with a touch of gourmet flair. The newly revamped menu, launched in October, pushes the boundaries even further boasting over thirty dishes that fuse familiar classics with global inspiration. Whether you’re here for a lazy brunch, an indulgent dessert, or a glass of something chilled on a Sunday evening, the café captures that rare blend of homeliness and sophistication.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Walk Like An Egyptian - Rs 399 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 Without a second thought this mediterranean inspired lamb waffle was insane, it has authentic mediterranean spice flavours like mint, oregano, parsley, paprika, rosemary, basil, bay leaf and the list goes on. All this was added in the right amount to hit that flavour spot. The flavours and aromas of this cuisine was very well enhanced by the spices used in this dish and will not hesitate to say that it's definitely worth the money.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Tangy cottage cheese with a dash of bell peppers and mozzarella cheese, this savoury waffle was more like a pizza as it's taste was quite similar to that of a pizza. But nonetheless the flavours will make it up to your taste buds.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Pita Tacos - Rs 279  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This has to be one of the most distinctive food items on their menu, though it's clearly not an authentic taco these pita tacos with perfectly blended hummus and paneer salsa, and right amount of tahini pickled chickpeas, topped with some nacho crumble will give you the perfect bite of joy especially for all the health fanatics out there, in terms of nutritional value pita tacos include both healthy and unhealthy aspects, but the filling here will make up for it. I am surely pleased with these tacos but the questions arises, will I order this again? Hmm maybe not.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Texmex Bowl - Rs 299 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Tex-mex bowl is the perfect one-dish supper for folks who are on the go. This flavoursome bowl had some fresh sweet american corn, parboiled white beans which are then baked with a hint of cheddar cheese. All these mixed with piquant mexican spicy salsa rossa, this elevated all the flavours and enhanced it giving you the best burst of flavours in your mouth. As quoted by a friend of mine,"This makes for a really great indian chat" which I feel like was quite true. Personally, I like anything which has baked beans so this dish was surely a yes for me.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Smokey Prawn - Rs 399 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Served hot, this smoky prawns were next on the top list, infused with some really strong aromatic flavours that just captured my soul which was one of the best feelings that turns out to be quite difficult to explain unless you get a whiff of it for yourself. Fresh pan grilled prawns, bell peppers, onion and other ingredients were for no doubt adding in flavours but the bbq sauce was to overpowering to my palate. One can taste the use of fresh tomatoes, vinegar and other spices that brings in the heat in this sauce. If I had to pick out one thing that I could change in this dish, then I think it would be the platting because I believe that one eats the food with their eyes first and then their mouth. Due to the overpowering flavours this dish didn't quite make the cut for me.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Creamy Pesto Prawns Risotto - Rs 499</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Sharing is caring, but when it comes to their creamy pesto prawns risotto this proverb will definitely not work well here. This dish wont fail to steal your heart and elevate all your food experiences till date. Fresh prawns and creamy parmesan cheese, so smooth that it will melt in your mouth in seconds and with passage of time you won't even realise how you ended up finishing the whole serving. Out of four friends of mine, only one of my friend ended up disliking it but nonetheless the rest of us loved it so much that we couldn't stop taking bites. If you are going out with your friends then I would suggest you to get more servings as you will hesitate to share this scrumptious dish.

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> All The Berry Best - Rs 399 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A flat cake which is often round and thin, contains beaten eggs that gives it fluffy texture and is prepared with starch-based batter is the home for all deserts. Didn’t get what I'm talking about? It obviously has to be pancakes duhh. Diesel café offers one of the best fluffy pancakes topped with some fresh leches and berries. Now, apart from having soft heart melting bite this pancake was also topped with granola mix which gives you the perfect amount of crunch and softness in your bite that wakes you up. Pancakes here were puffed, browned and heavenly sweet. Quote me when I say this that I wouldn’t mind a slight sugar rush after eating these delicious heart-warming pancakes, definitely worth it. Don’t hold yourself back while ordering another serving because it's all worth the happiness you gain after having the all the berry best (Image Not Included).

                                    Diesel Café continues to embody what Mangalore’s café scene does best - blending innovation with comfort. The revamped menu offers bold experiments like pita tacos and lamb waffles alongside timeless staples like their creamy risotto and indulgent pancakes. While a few dishes lean on the safer side of creativity, most of them hit the mark beautifully, especially when paired with their easy-going ambience and consistently good service. Whether you’re here for breakfast, brunch, or a relaxed dinner with friends, Diesel Café still manages to feel like that old friend who never disappoints - just with a new and improved flair.
