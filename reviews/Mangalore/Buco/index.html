                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 Reopened its doors towards December 2022, this little artisanal bakery has been cooking up quite a storm in the city ever since.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The interiors of Buco draw inspiration from the warmth of a typical Mangalorean home – red oxide flooring, terracotta hues, wooden textures, and open airy windows that flood the café with natural light. It’s minimal yet nostalgic, and the comfort in its design makes you want to linger, whether for a quick coffee or a long chatty brunch.    
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                What really makes Buco stand out, though, is the consistency of their food and drinks. No matter when you go – weekday or weekend – the flavors, presentation, and quality always remain top-notch. Every plate that comes out of their kitchen looks like it belongs on Instagram, but more importantly, tastes as good as it looks.    
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Mr Bobs Fried Chicken Burger - Rs 295 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                 A crowd-pleaser! The burger comes with a thick, crispy fried chicken fillet that’s juicy inside and golden on the outside. The seasoning is on point – a little peppery kick that pairs beautifully with the creamy mayo and crunchy lettuce. The bun itself is soft yet sturdy enough to hold it all together. Comfort food done right.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> The Sausage Crater - Rs 240 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This is more indulgent – a cheesy, meaty bake with sausage chunks nestled into a soft bread base. Each bite is a mix of gooey cheese, smoky sausage, and that satisfying bread pull. It’s hearty, and honestly, you could share this if you’re planning to try multiple dishes.    
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Kimchi Korean Bun - Rs 145 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A personal favorite! This bun has that distinct umami punch from the kimchi – slightly sour, spicy, and tangy – balanced with soft bread and a hint of sweetness. It’s unique for Mangalore, and Buco nails the flavor profile. Great for adventurous eaters.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Chilli Cheese Toast - Rs 190  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Classic café comfort. Thick slices of bread topped with gooey, stretchy cheese and a spicy chili hit. Simple, nostalgic, and very snackable. I could easily see myself ordering this every time as a side to coffee.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> BBQ Chicken Bun - Rs 295 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A fluffy bun stuffed with smoky BBQ chicken filling. The flavors lean slightly sweet with a tangy barbecue glaze that lingers on the palate. It’s comforting and hearty without being overwhelming.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Lemon Chello & Berry Cheesecake - Rs 220</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This dessert is a stunner – light, zesty, and refreshing. The lemon notes are bright and clean, cutting through the richness of the cheesecake, while the berries add that sweet-tart balance. It’s plated beautifully, so half the joy is in just looking at it before digging in.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Carrot Ghee Cake - Rs 120 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A slice of nostalgia. Dense, moist, and fragrant with ghee – it feels like something your grandma might bake, only elevated. The earthy sweetness of carrot shines through, and the ghee gives it a rich, buttery finish.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Strawberry Shawty - Rs 190 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A chilled dessert cup layered with cream, sponge, and strawberry. Light, fruity, and perfect if you don’t want something too heavy after a big meal. The strawberries taste fresh, and the cream is not overly sweet, which I appreciated.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Moccachino - Rs 180  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The perfect balance of coffee and chocolate. Smooth, not too bitter, with just enough sweetness to make it indulgent. A reliable pick for those who like their coffee with a dessert-like twist.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Mango Shawty - Rs 210  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Seasonal, tropical, and bursting with mango flavor. Similar in concept to the strawberry version but richer, thanks to the king of fruits. A must-try when mangoes are in season.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Nutella 3.0 - Rs 190 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This is for the chocolate lovers. A decadent dessert drink/dish that layers Nutella in a way that feels indulgent but not cloying. Rich, creamy, and very satisfying.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Iced Filter - Rs 190 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A modern take on the traditional South Indian filter coffee. Strong, aromatic, and refreshing over ice. Perfect for those who want the robustness of filter coffee but in a cooler, more café-style presentation.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Iced Americano - Rs 200 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Crisp, clean, and bold. Nothing fancy here, just straight-up strong coffee on ice. Great for purists who like it black and refreshing.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Butterfly Effect - Rs 190 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                One of Buco’s more playful drinks – made with butterfly pea flower tea that changes color when citrus is added. Light, floral, slightly citrusy – more of an experience than just a drink.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Sunset On Ice - Rs 190  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A beautiful layered drink that looks like a sunset in a glass. Fruity, tangy, and refreshing – perfect for summer.        
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Passion fruit Soda - Rs 190 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Bright, tropical, and tangy with that fizzy punch. It wakes up your palate instantly and pairs really well with their savory food items.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Another visual beauty – orange juice layered with coffee. The flavors are bold and a little unusual at first sip, but they grow on you. The citrus lifts the bitterness of the coffee, creating a surprisingly refreshing drink.        
                            </p>

                                    Buco is more than just a café – it’s a space where food, design, and culture come together. From the thoughtfully designed interiors to the carefully crafted menu, every element here speaks of passion and attention to detail.     
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    In a city where consistency is often hard to come by, Buco has managed to create a name for itself by ensuring that whether it’s a quick bun, a decadent dessert, or a beautifully brewed coffee – the quality never falters.    
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                    For me, Buco isn’t just one of the best cafés in Mangalore – it’s the spot where tradition, creativity, and reliability meet.
