                                Founded by Mr. Rahul reddy & based out of bombay (arguably the epicurean hotpot of india) subko is a feted part of the third wave of coffee revolution, bringing single-origin artisanal coffees to the connoisseurs table (read: not consumer) & some pretty rad continental snacks to boot. After that anticlimactic visit last year when I found them closed on the customary bandra monday, I finally experienced them now. Damn, that heady fragrance of freshly roasted
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                P.S. They get quite busy on the weekends, so I suggest you to pay them a visit in the weekdays to just sit back & relax over a great cup of coffee and some exquisite food.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                SCA scores are a big deal. ‘speciality coffee association’ scores list coffees based on a score from 1-100. Anything >80 is all of unanimously delicious (hence speciality coffee), ethically sourced, & a great bet if you’re looking for good stuff beyond commodity coffee. The lot available at the time I entered was #62 medium roast, & I opted for a iced pour-over, to thrill the entire mouth, not just the taste buds. No better start to the day.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Cold coffee brews are all the rage these days, & for good reason. When subject to higher temperature, coffee grounds get bitter, & lose some degree of flavour. The ‘cold’ with some ice bypasses all that, & these guys brew them just fine. A pick-me-up for sure, those looking for a quick hit of caffeine better take note!

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The harissa grilled cheese sandwich was supposed to be peppery & unhinged, to the level that one spicy epiphany would last seconds. It was anything but. The sourdough toast it was smeared in was lip-smackingly piquant & crunchy, though.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Espresso stuffed croissant was likely up there with the absolute best of ‘krwoissan’s I’ve had the pleasure of savouring in india. A thing of beauty is a joy forever, keats said. This buttery delight with the smidgen of espresso mascarpone on top & the other-worldly espresso cremé stuffing, will remain forever in the annals of my memory, & hopefully your visuals too.

                            </p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The chunky walnut dark cookie was chewy, & a fit, sobering foil to the cold brew. These combos have got to be savoured slowly, with the pitter-patter of rain beating on the glass close to you, & the smell of petrichor mingling with the bakery fixes.

                                    Subko feels less like a café and more like a creative philosophy - one that takes its coffee as seriously as art. What began for me as curiosity after tasting their baked goods evolved into genuine admiration for how grounded and intentional everything here is. They’ve built a space where craft and comfort coexist seamlessly - where even the simplest pour-over feels ceremonial. Whether you drop by for the brews, the bakes, or just the quiet rhythm of the place, Subko reminds you that good things take time - and are always worth waiting for.

                        <!-- Review Body -->
                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                            My first brush with Subko wasn’t over a café table but through a box of baked treasures brought back by Shriya Shetty from Mumbai. Mid-October, she handed me their Babka, Pain au Chocolat, and a golden Butter Croissant - and just like that, I was drawn into the world of Subko. I call it a realm because everything about them feels intentional - from the way their bakes are layered to how their beans are sourced and roasted. Naturally, when I found myself in Mumbai later that year, I made a beeline for Bandra… only to discover they were closed that day. Still, I was graciously allowed to look around - and even without a cup in hand, the aroma of freshly ground coffee was enough to seal my admiration for this space.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <div class="mb-8">
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-center">Here's What I Had</h2>
                            <br>
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Babka - Rs 260</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Rich, dense, and fragrant, the babka was the kind of pastry that demands you slow down. The tightly wound layers of dough and chocolate told a story of patience - soft on the inside, with just enough chew to make each bite satisfying. It wasn’t overly sweet, which I loved, letting the natural bitterness of the cocoa shine through. It felt both indulgent and comforting, the sort of dessert you’d pair with a dark roast on a quiet afternoon.  
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Pain au Chocolat - Rs 260</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This one leaned toward the classic — crisp exterior, glossy and golden, with a mellow, smooth chocolate core. While it didn’t quite surpass the croissant in terms of finesse, it was still a worthy companion to their coffee, striking a nice middle ground between richness and restraint.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Butter Croissant - Rs 175</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Flaky, golden, and beautifully laminated, this croissant was everything one could hope for in a classic pastry. Each layer offered a crisp whisper before giving way to a soft, buttery heart that melted effortlessly. The aroma itself could draw you in from a distance, and the balance of texture and flavour made it one of those timeless bakes you’d return for, again and again. Simple, precise, and incredibly well executed.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Single-Origin Coffees (250g each - Rs 541)</h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                As a consolation for not catching them open that day, I picked up two packs of their single-origin beans and that decision aged beautifully.
                                The medium roast from Kerehaklu Estate, Karnataka carried soft notes of peach iced tea, raw honey, and a light floral edge - a delicate, breezy cup perfect for slow mornings.
                                The medium-dark roast from Ampthill Downs, Tamil Nadu, in contrast, leaned bold and indulgent, with tasting notes of dark chocolate, hazelnut, and molasses. It was the kind of brew that wraps around you on late nights, indulgent yet grounding.

                                Even without the full café experience, Subko managed to leave a deep impression - and that says a lot. Every product I tried spoke of patience, technique, and a love for the craft that few brands embody. Their croissants were buttery and precise, the babka rich and layered, and the coffees - sourced from estates across South India - captured distinct terroirs with remarkable clarity. Beyond the food and coffee, what really stood out was their commitment to sustainability, right down to their biodegradable packaging. Subko doesn’t just make good coffee - it represents what Indian craftsmanship can achieve when passion meets purpose.
