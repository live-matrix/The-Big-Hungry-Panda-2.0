                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                There’s something oddly thrilling about chasing a food truck you know? the kind that doesn’t have a fixed address but somehow becomes a citywide obsession overnight. Eat Kried, a relatively new entrant in Bangalore’s food scene, has managed to do exactly that. They rolled into town sometime around September, and before anyone knew it, word spread like wildfire! A fried chicken truck serving some of the most flavour-packed burgers around. Naturally, I had to see what all the noise was about.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The first time I visited, Eat Kried had set up shop somewhere in Jayanagar. It was a lazy evening, and we somehow reached before they even opened. We waited about half an hour for them to start serving, completely unaware that this little truck was about to become the place everyone would soon be talking about. Fast forward to my second visit and this time in some street in JP Nagar and things had changed. The line was long, the crowd buzzing, and it took me nearly an hour and fifteen minutes just to place my order (I Kid You Not!). Normally, that kind of wait would test anyone’s patience, but with Eat Kried, the anticipation almost feels earned.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                To make things more dramatic, I was also trying to catch a train that night. So there I was half anxious, half starving begging Chahak who was taking orders to rush my order like it was a medical emergency. Thankfully, they did. My burger came out in twenty minutes, and I practically inhaled it before catching a Rapido to the station. If anyone saw a guy eating a burger like his life depended on it near the truck that night, that was probably me.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                But that’s the thing about Eat Kried, it’s chaos, hunger, and happiness all rolled into one experience. You wait, you grumble, you question your life choices halfway through the queue… and then you take that first bite, and suddenly it all makes sense.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Nice Guy Chicken Burger - Rs 190  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                A true classic. Crispy, well-seasoned fried chicken, tucked into a soft bun with a creamy, garlicky sauce that ties everything together. It’s indulgent, filling, and the kind of burger that makes you go quiet for a moment after the first bite.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Nice Guy Paneer Burger - Rs 190 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Surprisingly satisfying this one turned out to be, the paneer is well-marinated and thick, crispy on the outside, and perfectly soaks up that same signature sauce. Great option for anyone who doesn’t do meat but still wants all that flavour.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4"> Player Chicken Burger - Rs 210 </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This one brings a whole new flavour game to the table. Think of a peri-peri style burger with that familiar tangy heat that wakes your taste buds up in all the right ways. I don’t remember every detail about it, but I do remember enjoying it, it’s got that “just one more bite” vibe that keeps you going even when you’re full.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Hot Gochujang Chicken Burger - Rs 230  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                This one’s my personal favourite and easily Eat Kried’s best. It’s fiery, bold, and unapologetically spicy! a burger that doesn’t hold back. The gochujang glaze packs serious heat but is balanced by the richness of the chicken and sauce. It’s not for the faint-hearted, but for spice lovers like me, it’s perfection.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">  Kimchi Dust Chicken Strips - Rs 210  </h2>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                These strips are huge! easily some of the biggest I’ve seen from a food truck. The chicken itself is fantastic: juicy, crisp, and perfectly fried. The kimchi dust variant didn’t particularly stand out for me in terms of flavour, but even plain, those strips are a must-try.
                            </p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    Eat Kried is proof that good food doesn’t need four walls, air conditioning, or fancy plating. It just needs passion, good ingredients, and people who know what they’re doing. Yes, you’ll probably wait in line. Yes, they’ll run out early. And yes, you’ll question your choices halfway through. But when you finally take that bite whether you’re at Jayanagar, JP Nagar, or sprinting to a train station, you’ll know exactly why people are obsessed.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    That said, crowd management is definitely something Eat Kried needs to work on. The lines can get intense, and orders can take a while when the rush hits. Until they figure that part out, here’s my honest tip - show up at least 30 minutes before they open. It’s the safest way to get your hands on their food without having to camp in line for hours (And Trust Me, It Fills Up Fast).
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    Also, I wasn’t carrying my DSLR with me this time, so I had to make do with my phone but honestly, when the food’s this good, even a quick phone snap does it justice.
